                   I am a 22 year old self-taught programmer currently living in Nottinghamshire with my fiancée and our pet parrot, Pixel.
                   Having worked on a couple of websites for friends and family members, I am keen to jumpstart a career in the industry, learn new tricks and develop my skills further.
                   <br><br>
                   So far I have succeeded in making a handful of video games using the Unity Game Engine and the Blender Game Engine. The bulk of these projects were completed during my studies at Bray Institute of Further Education between 2014 and 2015. 
                   <br><br>
                   I'm a regular at local Tech events such as Tech Nottingham and I love meeting new people and geeking out about the things I love with them.
                   <br><br>
                   Thank you for visiting my website. I welcome feedback so please don't hesitate to get in touch.

                          <p>My proudest work to date, Cookie Catastrophe is a game developed for Android devices. It's a short endless runner demo in which players take the role of Chester the Cookie and have to make their way to the end of the level without dying.</p>

                          <p>Illusionary Generations was part of a group project completed in December 2015. I plan to rework the game in the near future. The original aim was to use the medium of video-games to showcase the different kind of dreams that different age groups experience. The current version puts players in the dream of a child.</p>

                          <p>The first game I ever made and the one that got me on the path I'm on at the moment. During the first year of 3D Games Design in BIFE, the class was tasked to make a top down 3D shooter. I chose to create an Asteroids clone and put my own spin on it. Thus, Fantasteroids was born and I promptly fell in love with Game Design and Development.</p>

                    <p>As of the writing of this post, I am currently creating a Pokémon Battle Simulator written entirely in C++ as a way for me to understand the language and have fun doing it. So far I have gotten a working battle system in the scenario of one battle against the player's Rival. I plan to include features to name the Rival, to level up Pokemon and add more to the party as well as the ability to use items in battle.</p>

This in-progress game follows the progress of a stuffy old Englishman named 'Earl Grey' as he sets out to collect all types of tea the world has to offer.

                    <p>HanaKotoba has been a while in the making. Originally starting life as an idea for a visual novel that I thought I would never make, having studied and played around with the SFML library of C++, I have finally begun development on it. The story follows a male protagonist as he meets the five heroines of the story at University, whose tales can all be discovered through decision trees and strategic wooing. This has been my pet project for a couple of years now and look forward to maki...(line truncated)...
